### Welcome!
I've always wanted to try all these new tools, libraries, and frameworks I've been hearing about. So I'm going to write a simple chat web app and then rewrite it for each thing I'm trying.

The file structure goes as follows:
- [step-number]-[step-name]
    - [technology-im-trying]
        - [project-files]

To get started with a project:

    - Open the [technology-im-trying] folder
    - Run the docker file to start the server on port 3000
    - If docker isn't available then:
        - Install node version >= 18.16.0
        - Run `npm install` to download the necessary packages
        - Run `npm start` to start the necessary services
